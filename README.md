# Task Manager API

This is a RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core that implements basic CRUD operations for task management. The project demonstrates key concepts such as:

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure the API using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses best practices with service and repository patterns.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database access with code-first migrations.

## Features

- Secure endpoints with JWT authentication.
- Clean separation of concerns using interfaces and dependency injection.
- Swagger integration for API documentation and testing.
- SQLite database configured via Entity Framework Core.
